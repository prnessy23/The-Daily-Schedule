# Solution
* The daily scheduler displays rows delineating hours of the day from 8am-6pm.
* Current day and date are displayed at the top of the page.
* Each hour row is color coded to reflect whether it's in the 'past','present' or 'future' depending on the given hour.
* Each hour row also has an input field and save button to allow for tasks to be created and 'saved' within the schedule.
* This 'saved' data will then be stored in local storage.
* This scheduler is both desktop and mobile compatible.
